:rotating_light: **GOV.UK Frontend is in private beta and these instructions are
subject to change. If you want to know more about how you can use GOV.UK
Frontend, please get in touch with the [Design System
team](mailto:govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) at
GDS.** :rotating_light:

## What is GOV.UK Frontend?

GOV.UK Frontend contains the code you need to start building a user interface
for government platforms and services.

See live examples of GOV.UK Frontend components, and guidance on when to use
them in your service, in the [GOV.UK Design
System](https://govuk-design-system-production.cloudapps.digital/).

## How to use GOV.UK Frontend

There are 2 ways to use GOV.UK Frontend:

* we recommend using <a href="#option-1-use-npm">option 1</a>, which requires
  using node package manager (NPM)
* you can also use <a href="#option-2-add-assets-manually">option 2</a>, which
  requires you to download the assets (CSS, JavaScript) from GitHub

## Option 1: Use NPM

### Requirements

To use GOV.UK Frontend with NPM you must:

1. Install the long-term support (LTS) version of
   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), which includes NPM. The minimum version of
   Node required is 8.6.0.

   (We recommend using [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing
   versions of Node.)

2. Create a [package.json file](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) if
   you don’t already have one. You can create a default `package.json` file by
   running `npm init` from the root of your application.

3. If you want to use the GOV.UK Frontend Nunjucks macros, install Nunjucks -
   the minimum version required is 3.0.0.

```
npm install nunjucks --save
```

### Installation

GOV.UK Frontend is currently in private beta. You will need to log in to NPM
using credentials provided by the Design System team.

Run the following command to log in:
```
npm login
```

Enter the username, password and email address you were provided with, when
prompted.

To install govuk-frontend, run:

```
npm install --save @govuk-frontend/govuk-frontend
```

After you have installed GOV.UK Frontend the `@govuk-frontend` package will
appear in your `node_modules` folder.

### Import styles

You need to import the GOV.UK Frontend styles into the main Sass file in your
project. You should place the below code before your own Sass rules (or Sass
imports) if you want to override GOV.UK Frontend with your own styles.

1. To import all components, add the below to your Sass file:

  ```CSS
  @import "node_modules/@govuk-frontend/govuk-frontend";
  ```

2. To import an individual component (for example a button), add the below to
your Sass file:

  ```CSS
  @import "node_modules/@govuk-frontend/button/button";
  ```

#### Optional: Resolve import paths

If you wish to resolve the above `@import` paths in your build (in order to
avoid prefixing paths with `node_modules`), you should add `node_modules` to
your [Sass include paths](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#includepaths)
(in Ruby, they should be added to [assets
paths](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#search-paths)).

For example, if your project uses Gulp, you would add the Sass include paths to
your Gulp configuration file (for example `gulpfile.js`) with
[gulp-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass). Below is an example:

```JS
gulp.task('sass', function () {
  return gulp.src('./sass/**/*.scss')
    .pipe(sass({
      includePaths: 'node_modules'
     }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./css'));
});

```

(If you compile Sass to CSS in your project, your build tasks will already
include something similar to the above task - in that case, you will just need
to include add `includePaths` to it.)

After resolving the import paths you can import GOV.UK Frontend by using:

```CSS
@import "@govuk-frontend/button/button";
```

#### Global Styles

[Global styles](src/globals/core/_global-styles.scss) are not included by default.

This is to avoid the risk of these globals conflicting with any pre-existing globals, for example in GOV.UK Elements or GOV.UK Template.

Hovever, we do include them in the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit-private-beta) to speed up prototyping.

To include global styles, you can set `$govuk-global-styles` variable to `true`.
```
// application.scss

$govuk-global-styles: true;

@import "govuk-frontend/all/all";
```

### Import JavaScript

You need to import the GOV.UK Frontend scripts into the main JavaScript file in your project.

To import and initialise all components that require JavaScript, add the below to your main JavaScript file:
```JS
import All from '@govuk-frontend/govuk-frontend'
```

To import an individual component (for example a button), add the below to your main JavaScript file:
```JS
import Button from '@govuk-frontend/button/button'
```

Use the following to initialise the button component:

```JS
new Button().init()
```

Note: The import syntax you should use depends on the JavaScript module format used by your bundler. For example, if it is using `CommonJS`, use

```JS
require('@govuk-frontend/govuk-frontend')
```

#### Polyfills
A JavaScript polyfill provides functionality on older browsers or assistive technology that do not natively support it.

The polyfills provided with GOV.UK Frontend aim to fix usability and accessibility issues. If there is a JavaScript included in the component directory, it is important to import and initialise it in your project to ensure that all users can properly use the component (see [Import Javscript](#import-javascript)).  

Examples of GOV.UK Frontend polyfills:
1. Links styled to look like buttons lack button behaviour. The polyfill script will allow them to be triggered with a space key after they’ve been focused, to match standard buttons.
2. Details component polyfill includes accessibility enhancements to ensure that the user is given appropriate information about the state (collapsed/expanded) of the component. The polyfill also makes the component behave correctly on IE8.

#### Bundling JavaScript
The JavaScript included in GOV.UK Frontend components are in [UMD (Universal Module Definition)](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) format which makes it compatible with AMD (Asynchronous module definition) and CommonJS.

##### Include with Webpack 4
Here's an example of setting up [`webpack.config.js`](examples/webpack/webpack.config.js) in your project

##### Include with Gulp and Rollup
You can configure Gulp and Rollup as part of your build process using the [gulp-better-rollup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-better-rollup) plugin. Below is an example:

```JS
gulp.task('compile', () => {
  return gulp.src('./js/*.js')
    .pipe(rollup({
      // Legacy mode is required for IE8 support
      legacy: true
    }))
    .pipe(uglify())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./js'));
})

```
(If you compile JavaScript in your project, your build tasks will already include something similar to the above task - in that case, you will just need to pipe `rollup` to it.)

### Import images and icons

In order to import GOV.UK Frontend images and icons to your project, you should
configure your application to reference or copy the relevant GOV.UK Frontend
assets.

1. Follow either [Recommended solution](#recommended-solution) or [Alternative
   solution](#alternative-solution).

2. Set `$govuk-global-images` variable in your project Sass file to point to the
   images folder in your project. Make sure you do this in Sass before importing
  `@govuk-frontend` into your project - see [Import styles](#import-styles).
  (`$govuk-global-images` is defined by default in
  `/node_modules/frontend/global/settings/_paths.scss`.)

#### Recommended solution:

Make `/node_modules/@govuk-frontend/icons` available to your project by routing
requests for your images folder there.

For example, if your project uses [express.js](https://expressjs.com/), below is
a code sample you could add to your configuration:

```JS
app.use('/icons', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '/node_modules/@govuk-frontend/icons')))
```

#### Alternative solution:

Manually copy the images from `/node_modules/@govuk-frontend/icons` into a
public facing directory in your project. Ideally copying the files to your
project should be an automated task or part of your build pipeline to ensure
that the GOV.UK Frontend images and icons stay up-to-date.

### Include assets

Add the CSS and JavaScript code to your HTML template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <head>
    <title>Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/application.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Copy and paste component HTML-->
    <button class="govuk-button">This is a button component</button>
    <script src="assets/application.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

If your service supports Internet Explorer 8, you will need to [generate and
include a separate stylesheet](docs/supporting-internet-explorer-8.md) as well.

### Usage

Copy and paste code from the examples in the
[GOV.UK Design System](https://govuk-design-system-production.cloudapps.digital/)
to use GOV.UK Frontend in your service.

## Option 2: Add assets manually

### Download assets

Download the latest versions of the following assets and include them in your
project:

- [css and javascript](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/tree/master/dist)
- [icons](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/tree/master/dist/icons)

### Include assets

Add the CSS and JavaScript code to your HTML template (this assumes you've copied the files to `/assets` in your project):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <head>
    <title>Example</title>
    <!--[if !IE 8]><!-->
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/govuk-frontend-[latest version].min.css">
    <!--<![endif]-->
    <!--[if IE 8]>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/govuk-frontend-old-ie-[latest version].min.css">
    <![endif]-->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Copy and paste component HTML-->
    <button class="govuk-button">This is a button component</button>
    <script src="assets/govuk-frontend-[latest version].min.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Usage

Copy and paste HTML code from the examples in the
[GOV.UK Design System](https://govuk-design-system-production.cloudapps.digital/)
to use GOV.UK Frontend in your service.

You will only be able to use Nunjucks templates if you install GOV.UK Frontend
using npm.

## Browser support

GOV.UK Frontend will allow you to build services that comply with the [guidance
in the Service Manual][service-manual-browsers].

Currently, GOV.UK Frontend officially supports the following browsers:

| Operating system | Browser                                | Support     |
|----------------- |----------------------------------------|-------------|
| Windows          | Internet Explorer 8                    | functional  |
| Windows          | Internet Explorer 9-11                 | compliant   |
| Windows          | Edge (latest 2 versions)               | compliant   |
| Windows          | Google Chrome (latest 2 versions)      | compliant   |
| Windows          | Mozilla Firefox (latest 2 versions)    | compliant   |
| macOS            | Safari 9+                              | compliant   |
| macOS            | Google Chrome (latest 2 versions)      | compliant   |
| macOS            | Mozilla Firefox (latest 2 versions)    | compliant   |
| iOS              | Safari for iOS 9.3+                    | compliant   |
| iOS              | Google Chrome (latest 2 versions)      | compliant   |
| Android          | Google Chrome (latest 2 versions)      | compliant   |
| Android          | Samsung Internet (latest 2 versions)   | compliant   |
| Windows Phone    | Internet Explorer (latest 2 versions)  | compliant   |

‘Compliant’ means that the components must look as good and function as well as
they do in other modern browsers.

'Functional' means the components may not look perfect in the given browser, but
must still be usable without errors and without 'looking broken'.

If you are including GOV.UK Frontend as part of a stylesheet that you are
generating in your application's build pipeline, you will need to [generate and
include a separate stylesheet in order to support Internet Explorer
8](docs/supporting-internet-explorer-8.md).
